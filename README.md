# Run Challenge Server
From a terminal execute `run_enodo_example_server.sh`.  It should create the necessary docker containers and open a web browser pointed at the site.

### Troubleshooting
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) needs to be installed
If for some reason it doesn't open a brower you can access the site (once both api and ui docker containers are running) at http://localhost:8080
